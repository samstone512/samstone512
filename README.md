Hi I am parsa 
I am not coding for being programer I do coding to solve a problem 
I am not a programmer, but my story of programming is interesting
long story short oneday I woke up with an urge to do something with my scattered knowledge and irresistible one 
I did not have any knowledge of programing beside every one have in university 
But I had two big advantages, AI and my irresistible will
